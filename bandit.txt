To connect to bandit we use the below command --:
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sshpass -p $(cat 2) ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220|
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
level1 --> To open special files in kali,we use cat ./(special file)
level2 --> To open files with spaces in file namew we use -:
               1.we can wrap the file name in spaces or use a backslash with every space.
		           example 1  cat "spaces in file name"
		           example 2  cat spaces\ in\ file\ name
level3 --> To find a hidden file we use (ls -a)
level4 --> Find a human-readable file / of ASCII type 
           we check a file type by using  (file filename)
level5 --> We find a file that is--: 1.human readable 
				     2.1033 bytes in size
				     3.not executable
           We use the find command.( find . -readable -size 1033c -not -executable )
level6 --> In this level the file is store in a file that is within the server.
           The file has the following properties --:
    		1.Owned by user bandit7
	    	2.Owned by group bandit6
		    3.Has a size of 33 bytes
           We can use (find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c)
	       but we get alot of permission denied
           We can redirect the errors using (2 >/dev/null/)
level7 --> The password is stored in a file known as data.txt next to the word millionth.
	       We can use (wc -l data.txt) to do a word count
           We can use cat data.txt the pipe results to grep millionth as below
           (cat data.txt  | grep millionth)
level8 --> In this level,the password is stored in data.txt and is in a line that occurs 
	       only once.
           We use the command (cat data.txt | sort | uniq -c )
           (sort) used to sort the text file.
           (uniq -c)  is used to check all duplicate lines and count them.
           (grep -v ) command excludes some text.
level9 --> In this level the password is in data.txt which has few 
           lines of human readable strings since it is a data file.
	       The password is preceded bu several "-" characters
           We use the strings command to find human readable text 
	       in a data file.
           (strings data.txt | grep =)
level10 -->The password is stored in data.txt which contains base64 encoded data.
           base64 is used to encode binary data as printable text.
           To work with base64 files we use the (base64 command)
           To decode the file we use (cat data.txt | base64 -d)
